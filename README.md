# CircuitPython
Bunch of CircuitPython code. Plunder away.

The Advice box uses a QTPY RP2040 and an APDS-9960 sensor to give people advice... whether it is good or not is up to them, but it is something I use for teaching people coding in workshops.

The handout will be forthcoming, but the files (if you're playing along at home) that you would load on your formatted drive is now available in zip form. The file for formatting the QTPY RP2040 is available both here and at https://circuitpython.org/board/adafruit_qtpy_rp2040/
